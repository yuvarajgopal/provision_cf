I have just committed, tagged, and pushed version 1.3.0 of the
cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

Some specific changes include

   * Enhanced EBS Volume Support for the generic server template
     [see the README file]

   * The OPS_ALERTS_TOPIC variable is now exposed from the userdata
     scripts so it can be used to publish alert messages.  For
     example, the signal-wait-condition.sh bootstrap helper now
     publishes a message when server provisioning is complete.

   * Changes and Enhancements to some bootstrap scripts to support the
     new features.

   * Chef client updated to 11.16.4 (via
     bootstrap/sncr-aws-versions.sh)

   * Some Fixes, including
     - BootPriority and Purpose tags are updated now


This release of cft-core requires cftgen 2.2.1 (or newer), so you will
probably need to check that out and install it as well.  It should
work fine with any recent version of provision_aws (the latest is
0.3.1)

The git repository is in git.synchronoss.net:/git/devops/aws/libs/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project.
This release is at git tag "v1.3.0" -- checkout that tag and use it in
you projects by copying or "unhooking" it from its git repo.  DO NOT
modify your checked out copy directly.

To use this new version in an existing project, be sure to upload the
new helper (bootstrap scripts) and the new chef client rpm to the s3
public bucket.  I have tried to make the helper scripts backwards
compatible.


There is some documentation right now in a README file.  There is a
Confluence page at

http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/cft-core+--+CloudFormation+Template+Core+Library

which I have been populating.  This page is in the “AWS Architecture”
area of the DevOps space at
