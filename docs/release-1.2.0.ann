I have just committed, tagged, and pushed  version 1.0.0 of our cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

Some specific changes include
       * BootPriority and Purpose parameters and instance tags
       * gave the nat instance its own security group, in its own template
       * removed chef-squid-proxy from sample .conf
       * removed duplicate iam role from iam-roles
       * some additional/enhanced comments

This release of cft-core requires cftgen 2.1.7 (or newer), so you will probably need to check that out and install it as well.

The git repository is in git.synchronoss.net:/git/devops/aws/libs/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project.  This release is at git tag v1.0.0


There is some documentation right now in a README file.  There is a Confluence page at http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/cft-core+--+CloudFormation+Template+Core+Library which I have been populating.  This page is in the “AWS Architecture” area of the DevOps space at http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/AWS+Architecture?src=contextnavchildmode
