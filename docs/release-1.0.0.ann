I have just committed, tagged, and pushed  version 1.0.0 of our cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

The git repository is in git.synchronoss.net:/git/devops/aws/libs/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project.  This release is at git tag v1.0.0

Do not try to push back to the git repo! We would like to use JIRA for reporting issues and requesting enhancements.

There is only minimal documentation right now in a README file.  There is an (empty for now) Confluence page too at http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/cft-core+--+CloudFormation+Template+Core+Library which I will begin to populate.  This page is in the “AWS Architecture” area of the DevOps space at http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/AWS+Architecture?src=contextnavchildmode

I will be happy to answer any questions.

Several of you have already seen how they work in conjunction with provision_aws at various levels of development.  They were most recently demonstrated in the Seattle office for some training and then used to launch prod and uat environments for a new project.

This set of templates was originally used for the devops OpsHub proof of concept, and then applied to the ContentHub project. If I made any translation mistakes when removing opshubs and contenthub references, please let me know and I will fix that.  I am sure there will be some point releases as I add documentation and fix minor things like that.

These templates, in conjunction with the provisioning tools (provision_aws and ctgen), and a properly populated chef server have proven to be a quick, powerful, and reliable way to spin up AWS project environments.
