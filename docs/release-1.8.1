CFT-CORE 1.8.1 (git tag v1.8.1)
===============================

I have just committed, tagged, and pushed version 1.8.1 of the cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

This is a library of some core CloudFormation templates that can be used as the basis for an AWS project.

With these templates and the provision_aws and cftgen tools (packaged separately), it is possible to quickly spin up a new AWS environment using the standard model of dmz subnets, private subnets, and public subnets across two availability zones.  The templates were designed to be modular and reusable.  Some templates are specific, like the chef server and chef squid proxy, but even those can be used as reference templates to craft other custom template.

Some specific changes in this (minor) release include...

  * Nat and Bastion IAM Roles, reduced access in the AppRole
  * enhanced server CNAME support to allow private and public ones
  * add cidrs and acl/sgs rules for ivpc ssh access
  * a template to create an EC2 placement group.
  * conditionally put a server instance into a placement group
  * conditionally specify a server's tenancy (dedicated instances)
  * specify a private ip address for a server instance
  * specify an extra (bootstrap) helper script for server instance launch
  * improved validation testing via the Makefile

Placement Groups
-----------------

Placement groups direct instances to be launched "close to each other" to improve connectivity (reduce network latency).  Not all instance types can go into placement groups.

A placement group resource must be defined before it can be used.  As an example, the ec2-placementgroup.cft template can be used to create a single placement group named ClusterPG, or additional placement groups can be created and referenced as needed.


Prerequisites
-------------

This release of cft-core (probably) requires cftgen 2.5.1 (or newer), so you will probably need to check that out and install it as well. It should work fine with any recent version of provision_aws (the latest is 0.3.6)

Obtaining CFT-CORE
------------------

The git repository is now in the Stash devops project at ssh://git@stash.synchronoss.net:7999/devops/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project. This release is at git tag "v1.8.1" -- checkout that tag and use it in you projects by copying or "unhooking" it from its git repo.  DO NOT modify your checked out copy directly!

To use this new version in an existing project, be sure to upload the new helper (bootstrap scripts) and the chef client 11.12 rpm to the S3 public bucket.  I have tried to make the helper scripts backwards compatible.

   IMPORTANT: When using Enterprise Chef in AWS,

* DO NOT USE A CHEF CLIENT WITH A VERSION GREATER THAN 11.12!

  - Newer clients proxy all traffic through the chef proxy in the IVPC and this is not compatible with our architecture.  We are working with Chef for a solution which will allow us to use newer clients.


Documentation
-------------

There is some documentation right now in a README file.  There is a Confluence page at

http://confluence.synchronoss.net:8085/display/DEVOPS/cft-core+--+CloudFormation+Template+Core+Library

which I have been populating.  This page is in the "AWS Architecture" area of the DevOps space at
