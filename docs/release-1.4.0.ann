I have just committed, tagged, and pushed version 1.4.0 of the
cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

This is a library of some core CloudFormation templates that can be
used as the basis for an AWS project.

With these templates and the provision_aws and cftgen tools (packaged
separately), it is possible to quickly spin up a new AWS environment
using the standard model of dmz subnets, private subnets, and public
subnets across two availability zones.  The templates were designed to
be modular and reusable.  Some templates are specific, like the chef
server and chef squid proxy, but even those can be used as reference
templates to craft other custom template.

Some specific changes in this release include...

  * Support for Enterprise Chef
    - Additional CFT Params (notably ChefOrg)
    - Enhanced bootstrap/install-chef-client.sh helper script
    - CHEF_ORG added to userdata scripts
  * added simple versioning to cf4/cft files
  * new network-route53.cf[4t] to create the dns zone
  * new network-routing.cf[4t] to create route tables
    - includes support for routing to a vpc-peer

This release of cft-core requires cftgen 2.2.4 (or newer), so you will
probably need to check that out and install it as well.  It should
work fine with any recent version of provision_aws (the latest is
0.3.1)

The git repository is now in stash at ssh://git@stash.synchronoss.net:7999/devops/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project.
This release is at git tag "v1.4.0" -- checkout that tag and use it in
you projects by copying or "unhooking" it from its git repo.  DO NOT
modify your checked out copy directly.

To use this new version in an existing project, be sure to upload the
new helper (bootstrap scripts) and the chef client 11.12 rpm to the s3
public bucket.  I have tried to make the helper scripts backwards
compatible.

   IMPORTANT: When using Enterprise Chef,
              DO NOT USE A CHEF CLIENT WITH A VERSION GREATER THAN 11.12!

              Newer clients proxy all traffic through the chef proxy
              in the IVPC and this is not compatible with our
              architecture.  We are working with Chef for a solution
              which will allow us to use newer clients.


There is some documentation right now in a README file.  There is a

which I have been populating.  This page is in the "AWS Architecture"
