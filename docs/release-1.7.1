CFT-CORE  1.7.1 (git tag v1.7.1)
================================

I have just committed, tagged, and pushed version 1.7.1 of the
cft-core template library for AWS CloudFormation.

This is a library of some core CloudFormation templates that can be
used as the basis for an AWS project.

With these templates and the provision_aws and cftgen tools (packaged
separately), it is possible to quickly spin up a new AWS environment
using the standard model of dmz subnets, private subnets, and public
subnets across two availability zones.  The templates were designed to
be modular and reusable.  Some templates are specific, like the chef
server and chef squid proxy, but even those can be used as reference
templates to craft other custom template.

Some specific changes in this (minor) release include...

  * attach the first four ephemerals volumes
  * attach the cf4 so an arbitrary number of ephemerals can be attached

Ephemeral Storage
------------------

Many AWS instance types provide (optional) local storage.
  - The number and size of these mounts is determine by the instance
    size.
  - Since ephemeral storage is locally attached, it is faster than EBS
  - They can only be attached at instance launch time, unlike EBS
    volumes which can be created and attached anytime.
  - Note that any data on an ephemeral device will be lost of the
    instance is ever stopped.
  - When an instance is started, the ephemeral devices are formatted as an
    empty file system.

The new server.cf[4t] template will always list the first four
ephemeral volumes, and if they exist for the interlace type being
launched will be attached on the devices listed in the
EphemeralDevList CF parameter.  In the past, only the first ephemeral
was typically attached with the intent of hosting a swap file.

Although the devices will be attached, it is the responsibility of the
deployment configuration to mount and use the volumes.

Prerequisites
-------------

This release of cft-core (probably) requires cftgen 2.4.2 (or newer),
so you will probably need to check that out and install it as well.
It should work fine with any recent version of provision_aws (the
latest is 0.3.6)

Obtaining CFT-CORE
------------------

The git repository is now in the Stash devops project at
ssh://git@stash.synchronoss.net:7999/devops/cft-core.git

You can clone this repository, and then copy it into a new project.
This release is at git tag "v1.6.2" -- checkout that tag and use it in
you projects by copying or "unhooking" it from its git repo.  DO NOT
modify your checked out copy directly!

To use this new version in an existing project, be sure to upload the
new helper (bootstrap scripts) and the chef client 11.12 rpm to the s3
public bucket.  I have tried to make the helper scripts backwards
compatible.

   IMPORTANT: When using Enterprise Chef in AWS,
              DO NOT USE A CHEF CLIENT WITH A VERSION GREATER THAN 11.12!

              Newer clients proxy all traffic through the chef proxy
              in the IVPC and this is not compatible with our
              architecture.  We are working with Chef for a solution
              which will allow us to use newer clients.


Documentation
-------------

There is some documentation right now in a README file.  There is a
Confluence page at

which I have been populating.  This page is in the "AWS Architecture"
